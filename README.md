#  Clinical Trial Summary Report – Dapagliflozin (NCT01400884)

This project simulates a real-world clinical trial summary analysis using public data from a Phase III trial of **Dapagliflozin in Type 2 Diabetes (NCT01400884)**. The objective was to analyze and visualize key clinical metrics, adverse events, and survival trends using R to emulate workflows relevant to roles in clinical research, pharmacovigilance, and clinical data management.

## Project Objectives

- Explore, clean, and summarize clinical trial data
- Perform descriptive statistics on baseline and treatment groups
- Profile **Adverse Events (AEs)** and serious AEs
- Conduct **Kaplan-Meier survival analysis**
- Build **interactive visualizations** using `plotly` and `DT`
- Simulate end-to-end reporting for internal review or publication

---

## Tools & Packages Used

- `tidyverse`, `dplyr`, `janitor` – Data cleaning & wrangling  
- `ggplot2`, `plotly`, `ggpubr` – Data visualization  
- `survival`, `survminer` – Survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier curves)  
- `DT` – Interactive tables  
- `knitr`, `rmarkdown` – Reporting
